Fun little text-based card/adventure game!

An idea I had was to make a text-based (for now, until I implement a GUI) game based
off of a drinking game called "Ride the Bus". 

How would this work as a game, as opposed to a drinking game?
    - Usually each round played you have to guess a card, and assign someone to drink.
    - Each round played correctly would make your card (character) stronger, rpg style.
